# Brisbane Python User Group Talks Archive

This repository is used to schedule and archive talks given at the
[Brisbane Python User
Group](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Python-User-Group/).

For general admin issues & notes, use the separate
[BrisPy admin repo](https://github.com/BrisPy/brispy-admin)

## Submitting an Idea

If you have an idea for a talk or might want to hear about a certain
topic, file a [Github
issue](https://github.com/BrisPy/talks/issues/new). If there is already
an idea in our [issues list](https://github.com/BrisPy/talks/issues)
feel free to vote on it by leaving a comment.

In case you don't have a github account, email the
[organizers](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Python-User-Group/members/?op=leaders)
to schedule an idea for you.
